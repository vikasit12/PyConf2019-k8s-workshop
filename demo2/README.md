# Demo2


## Changes from previous demo

In the previous demo we've created few of the objects with `kubectl` command line utility but here in the demo we gonna use Manifest (Yaml representation of objects) to deploy a python flask microservice app with Celeris and Redis.

## Now how to run demo2?

```
kubectl apply -f <manifest>.yaml
```
